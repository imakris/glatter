# glatter ‚Äî OpenGL‚Äëfamily loader & tracer

[![Build and Test Glatter](https://github.com/imakris/glatter/actions/workflows/main.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/imakris/glatter/actions/workflows/main.yaml)

A practical loader and tracer for GL‚Äëfamily APIs (GL, GLX, WGL, EGL, GLES, optional GLU). Resolves symbols on first use, lets you log calls or just errors, and warns on cross‚Äëthread usage. Works in C and C++ with sensible defaults.

---

## Technical summary

* **Integration:** header‚Äëonly (C++) or compiled translation unit (C/C++).
* **WSI detection:** auto‚Äëdetects WGL/GLX/EGL with optional runtime override.
* **On‚Äëdemand symbols:** function pointers are resolved on first use to minimize startup work.
* **Diagnostics:** opt‚Äëin call/error logging; in debug builds (when `NDEBUG` is not defined) errors are logged by default. Messages go to stdout/stderr; install a custom handler only if you want to redirect.
* **Utilities:** generated extension flags (e.g., `glatter_GL_ARB_vertex_array_object`) and `enum_to_string_*()` helpers.

## Choose your integration mode

Pick **one** of the two ways to use glatter:

### 1) Header‚Äëonly (C++ only)

```cpp
#include <glatter/glatter_solo.h>
// Use GL entry points as usual
glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);
```

For header-only usage, include `<glatter/glatter_solo.h>`. This tiny wrapper defines
`GLATTER_HEADER_ONLY` and includes the main header for you.

### 2) Compiled C translation unit (C or C++)

```c
#include <glatter/glatter.h>
/* Add src/glatter/glatter.c to your build */

// Use GL entry points as usual
glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);
```

**Note:** Do not include system GL headers yourself (e.g., `GL/gl.h`, `EGL/egl.h`). Glatter chooses the right ones for you.

---

## Quick start

1. Add the `include/` directory to your compiler‚Äôs include paths.
2. Choose either **header‚Äëonly** (C++) or **compiled TU** (C/C++), as shown above.
3. Link platform libraries (see Integration notes).
4. Optional: install a custom log sink only if you want to redirect messages away from stdout/stderr.

### CMake smoke tests for CI/CD

A companion CMake configuration replicates the build smoke-tests previously implemented in `tests/test_build.py`. It compiles representative consumers for both the compiled C translation unit and the header-only C++ modes, checks the static-library workflow, and exercises the internal EGL context-key helper using stubbed entry points.

```bash
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
ctest --test-dir build
```

The default build also verifies that the WGL headers continue to compile when paired with the lightweight Windows stubs in `tests/include/`. These targets have no runtime dependencies and are meant purely as CI/CD guardrails.

---

## Window System Interface (WSI) selection (auto and overrides)

Glatter auto‚Äëselects the appropriate Window System Interface (WSI) for your platform.

Optional WSI override (function call or env var):

```c
/* Optional WSI override (defaults are auto‚Äëdetected).
   Alternatively set: GLATTER_WSI=egl|glx|wgl */

glatter_set_wsi(GLATTER_WSI_EGL); /* or WGL, GLX, AUTO */
```

WSI is latched at **first successful resolution** in the process. Changing the environment variable or calling
`glatter_set_wsi()` after first use has no effect for the remainder of the process.

**Thread-safety & determinism:** In `AUTO` mode, WSI detection is fully thread-safe. A tiny atomic gate ensures the decision is made exactly once, proceeding in a fixed order (Windows: WGL‚ÜíEGL; POSIX: GLX‚ÜíEGL). Both header-only and compiled TU modes are functionally correct and thread-safe. The choice is one of project architecture:

*   **Header-only (C++):** State is managed per translation unit. All TUs will deterministically converge to the same WSI.
*   **Compiled TU (C/C++):** State is centralized in a single, shared object, which can reduce code size.


## Typical single‚Äëcontext app

```cpp
#include <glatter/glatter_solo.h> // header‚Äëonly C++ header
// for C/C++ compiled TU use <glatter/glatter.h> and compile src/glatter/glatter.c

int main() {
    // Create and make a GL context current here
    // ...

    // Gate once on a requirement (example: VAOs)
    if (!glatter_GL_ARB_vertex_array_object) {
        // Extension not available ‚Üí bail out or use a fallback
        return 1;
    }

    // Safe to use the corresponding functions
    GLuint vao = 0;
    glGenVertexArrays(1, &vao);
    glBindVertexArray(vao);

    glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);
    return 0;
}
```

## API summary (essentials)

* **WSI override/inspect**: `glatter_set_wsi(GLATTER_WSI_*)`, `glatter_get_wsi()` (APIs use the term "Window System Interface (WSI)").
* **Extension flags**: test generated flags like `glatter_GL_ARB_vertex_array_object` once the context is current.
* **Enum names**: `enum_to_string_*()` for readable GL/GLX/WGL/EGL/GLU enums.

Notes: Diagnostics and multi‚Äëcontext thread checks are covered under **Tracing & diagnostics**. Low‚Äëlevel entry‚Äëpoint helpers are documented under **Advanced** and are rarely needed.

## Tracing & error logging

By default, messages go to stdout/stderr. Install a custom log handler only to redirect or integrate with your own logging.

Two independent, opt‚Äëin layers:

* `GLATTER_LOG_CALLS` Log every wrapped call (name, args, return).
* `GLATTER_LOG_ERRORS` Log only API errors.

If neither is defined, **debug builds default to error‚Äëonly logging** (i.e., when `NDEBUG` is not defined).

Redirect output to your sink:

```c
void my_log_sink(const char* msg) { /* route to your logger */ }
int main() {
    glatter_set_log_handler(my_log_sink);
}
```

> Note: ARB/KHR debug output still needs a debug context; glatter‚Äôs error checks work independently.

For WGL wrappers, glatter sets `SetLastError(0)` immediately before the call so the subsequent
`GetLastError()` check reflects that call. This avoids reporting a stale error from unrelated
WinAPI calls; any `GetLastError()` observed right after the wrapper reflects that specific WGL call.

---

## Thread ownership checks

Glatter tracks an "owner thread" and warns when calls come from a different thread.

* **Header‚Äëonly C++:** first touching thread becomes owner. Call `glatter_bind_owner_to_current_thread()` early if you want explicit control. Define `GLATTER_REQUIRE_EXPLICIT_OWNER_BIND` to require an explicit bind, otherwise the library aborts on first use without binding.
* **Compiled C/C++:** the owner is captured on first use; later calls from other threads are reported.

This is diagnostic only. Glatter does not serialize or block.

---

## Extension requirements

Use the generated boolean flags `glatter_<EXTENSION_NAME>` after a context is current. Example (VAOs):

```c
if (!glatter_GL_ARB_vertex_array_object) {
    /* Report and exit early or use a fallback */
    return 1;
}

GLuint vao = 0;
glGenVertexArrays(1, &vao);
glBindVertexArray(vao);
```

---

## GLX Xlib error handler

When using the GLX WSI, glatter installs a small X error handler the first time GLX is touched, to surface common GLX/Xlib issues. To opt out and install your own handler (for example after `XInitThreads()`), define:

```c
#define GLATTER_DO_NOT_INSTALL_X_ERROR_HANDLER
```

**Xlib threading:** If your app uses Xlib from multiple threads, you must call `XInitThreads()` **before any Xlib call**.
Glatter does not call it for you. In multi-threaded Xlib apps, call `XInitThreads()` early (e.g., at program start) and
consider `#define GLATTER_DO_NOT_INSTALL_X_ERROR_HANDLER` to install your own handler under your threading model.

---

## Building & Integration

Glatter is a simple, dependency-light library designed for easy integration using CMake.

### Using Glatter in Your Project (Consumer)

To use `glatter` in your own CMake project, first build and install it. Then, you can link it as follows:

**C++ app (header‚Äëonly):**
```cmake
# Add the include directory
target_include_directories(my_app PRIVATE path/to/glatter/include)

# Link platform libraries
if(WIN32)
  target_link_libraries(my_app PRIVATE opengl32)
else()
  # On POSIX, link against GL, Threads, X11, and dl
  find_package(Threads REQUIRED)
  target_link_libraries(my_app PRIVATE GL Threads::Threads X11::X11 dl)
endif()
````

**C/C++ app (compiled TU):**
````cmake
# Find the installed glatter package
find_package(glatter REQUIRED)

# Link it to your application
target_link_libraries(my_app PRIVATE glatter::glatter)
````

### Building Glatter from Source

Building the compiled library is straightforward. You will need standard build tools (CMake, C/C++ compiler) and the development libraries for OpenGL on your system.

````sh
# Configure the project
cmake -B build -S .

# Build the library
cmake --build build --config Release
````

---

## Advanced configuration

### Windows character encoding

Handles UNICODE and MBCS builds. The generator assumes UNICODE by default; on non-UNICODE builds, the `GLATTER_WINDOWS_MBCS` switch is automatically set unless you define it yourself. This keeps TCHAR handling correct without extra setup.

### Regenerating headers (optional)

Two headers are meant for power users:

* `glatter_config.h` Feature/platform switches. Define `GLATTER_USER_CONFIGURED` and set your own `GLATTER_*` macros to opt out of the defaults.
* `glatter_platform_headers.h` The list of API headers glatter should use. If you edit this, re‚Äërun the generator.

1. Place target API headers under `include/glatter/headers/`.
2. Add the bundle to `glatter_platform_headers.h` (one `#include` per line, no trailing comments).
3. Run either:
   * `python include/glatter/glatter.py`
   * `cd include/glatter && python glatter.py`

If `GLATTER_HAS_EGL_GENERATED_HEADERS` is off for your target, EGL/GLES helpers are unavailable until you generate the headers; the library still builds.

---

## Troubleshooting

* **‚ÄúFailed to resolve ‚Ä¶‚Äù** Ensure a current context and that GL/EGL/GLES libraries are visible on your platform.
* **Cross‚Äëthread warnings** Call `glatter_bind_owner_to_current_thread()` on the render thread, or enable strict binding with `GLATTER_REQUIRE_EXPLICIT_OWNER_BIND`.
* **GLX error spam** Define `GLATTER_DO_NOT_INSTALL_X_ERROR_HANDLER` and install your own after X threading init.
* **Missing EGL/GLES generated headers** Builds still succeed; EGL/GLES helpers are unavailable until you generate headers.
* **Platform family mismatch** Ensure you didn‚Äôt enable a platform wrapper unavailable on your target (e.g., WGL on Linux,
  GLX on Windows). Pick only the families that exist on the current platform.
* **WSI override not taking effect** The WSI is latched at first use. Set `GLATTER_WSI` or call `glatter_set_wsi()` **before**
  the first GL/WSI call.
